Errors and challenges encountered

1. wildfly: deploy and wildfly: run didn't work
-> Solution:
	- local host port 8080 is not available
	- Need JDK 1.8 instead of JRE 1.8 in my run time environment because JRE doesn't contain tools.jar file
	
2. Cookies are not deleted after browser exited
-> Solution:
	- Need javascript on client side to detect it because on server side we can only use session time out
	
3. Why do we need web service for search while we already have web server connects to the database?
-> Solution:
	- We create a new rest web Service project that so that our web server can retrieve and modify information
	Issue: Security?
	-> Solution: add md5 checksum into the link so that only our client web Server that has the key
	can access information
	
4. & doesn't work in href link
-> Solution:
	- &amp; replace & in href link because & is a special/functional char in HTML/XML

5. Order has CustomerID property set to insertable=false and updateable = false
-> Solution:
	- Move it to relationship mapping many to one because we need to save customerID into ordertable
	upon saving into table

6. REST web service is not necessarily need WADL and WSDL because it is "self-describe"
-> "self-descibe" means:
	- through HTTP OPTIONS request, web service deliver document describing all relevant resources

7. Request json data at localhost:8080 fails to execute
-> Chrome has security that prevents user to use local custom javascript files

8. PUT request doesn't work
-> A lot of major webbrowsers doesn't support put and delete, so we can use get and post instead

9. onclick return false
-> to prevent default action of event or to prevent propagation of event of ancestor elements
